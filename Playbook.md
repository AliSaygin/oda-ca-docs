# Introduction to the ODA Component Accelerator Project (ODA-CA)

**The Open Digital Architecture**

ODA is an enterprise architecture blueprint for modular, cloud native open digital platforms that can be orchestrated using AI.  It is being developed and maintained by members of [TM Forum](https://www.tmforum.org/).  You can start learning about ODA [here](https://www.tmforum.org/oda/).

[ODA Components](https://www.tmforum.org/oda/implementation/technical-architecture-components/) are the standardized, reusable, microservices-based software building blocks of ODA, connected via [Open APIs](https://www.tmforum.org/oda/implementation/open-apis/). ODA Components are deployed onto an [ODA Canvas](https://www.tmforum.org/oda/deployment-runtime/oda-canvas/), which provides a standardized execution environment along with the release automation part of a CI/CD pipeline.

**Check if your company is already involved in developing ODA**

If your company is a TM Forum member (check [here](https://www.tmforum.org/membership/current-members/), you can join the ODA collaboration projects [here](https://myaccount.tmforum.org/joinproject) to contribute to ODA and influence its development.

If your company has signed the [ODA manifesto](https://www.tmforum.org/oda/open-digital-architecture-open-api-manifesto/), then it is already committed to ODA's design principles and essential standards to enable a truly ‘plug and play’ set of technology capabilities.

**The ODA-CA project**
 
The ODA Component Accelerator (ODA-CA) is a practical project run by TM Forum member companies in our Open Digital Lab environment. The aims are:

* Collaborative development of the ODA Canvas and ODA Reference Implementation(s) in order to validate ODA in real world applications
* Building a test environment and tooling to validate vendors' commercial products for conformance to the ODA Component specifications
* Developing best practices for deployment of ODA Components and the ODA Canvas 
* Accelerating the ODA standards by contributing practical implementation experience back into the standardization process

Since the project [started in December 2020](https://www.tmforum.org/press-and-news/leading-telecoms-companies-collaborating-to-build-market-for-plug-and-play-software/) we have:

* Built an execution environment for ODA reference implementations based on standard Kubernetes infrastructure
* Built a ‘click-to-deploy’ reference Canvas for TM Forum members to use
* Delivered a prototype Component CTK which validates security and functional aspects of ODA Components using a 3-stage test platform in the Open Digital Lab
* Deployed a number of commercial applications onto the reference Canvas and validated them with the prototype Component CTK
* Demonstrated deployment patterns for security and observability use cases

**ODA-CA 'Show & Tell' videos**

* [Video recording](https://video.ibm.com/channel/24077591/video/lf09c2) and [notes including presentations](https://projects.tmforum.org/wiki/x/bfowCQ). Covers the Open Digital Lab environment and an initial proof-of-concept for automated ODA compliance validation of ‘black box’ and ‘glass box’ commercial products.

Covers Security Validation of ODA Components, an API Operator for Whale Cloud API Gateway and Oracle Proxy Components. Includes proposed roadmap for next sprints.

* The [demo here](https://projects.tmforum.org/wiki/x/oqu2CQ) explains the concepts of security / party role validation for ODA components
