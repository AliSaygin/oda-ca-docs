# Postman API testing guide

It is good practice to use an API Browser to capture a collection of tests against an API. The examples below are using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) which is widely used by the TM Forum Open-API team.

Postman provides a way of directly testing the APIs exposed by a component, including full control of the headers. The example below shows a postman collection for the ProductCatalog example ODA Component.
