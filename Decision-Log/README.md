# Architecture Decision Log

This folder contains a log of architectural decisions made on this project, including their status, context, the decision and the known consequences. We will add to this log through the development of ODA-CA and version control all the decisions. There is a useful guide at https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/design/design-reviews/decision-log/ and the original article is at https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions
