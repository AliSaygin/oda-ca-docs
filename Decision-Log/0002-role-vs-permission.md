# 1. Role vs Permissions

Date: 2013-04-06

## Status

In progress

## Context

In the feedback issue for authentication use-cases https://github.com/tmforum-oda/oda-canvas/issues/62#issuecomment-1493726891 @gjo-satec raises the question of whether components should define roles or permissions (and have the roles defined in the IDM solution).
@brian-burton added a question of technical vs business roles and proposed the components expose technical roles with business roles defined in the IDM solution. 

We held a deep-dive into the TMF672 UserRole API with [@JonathanGoldberg](https://www.github.com/JonathanGoldberg)
[@brian-burton](https://www.github.com/brian-burton)
[@gjo-satec](https://www.github.com/gjo-satec)
[@lesterthomas](https://www.github.com/lesterthomas).
The recomendation was to use the PermissionSpecSet
