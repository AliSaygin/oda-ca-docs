# 1. Role vs Permissions

Date: 2013-04-06

## Status

In progress

## Context

In the feedback issue for authentication use-cases https://github.com/tmforum-oda/oda-canvas/issues/62#issuecomment-1493726891 @gjo-satec raises the question of whether components should define roles or permissions (and have the roles defined in the IDM solution).
@brian-burton added a question of technical vs business roles and proposed the components expose technical roles with business roles defined in the IDM solution. 

Proposed next step is to do a deep-dive into the TMF672 UserRole API and look at examples of its implementation.

## Decision
